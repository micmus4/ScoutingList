# ScoutingList


Hello, this is my biggest JavaFX project to date. It is an application that provides you a possibility to store information about Footballers from all over the world and look through it as you see fit. Every single Football is described by exactly 10 different information such as name, market value or manager that represents the player. Since in real life scouting lists are usually huge and professional scouts can keep information about hundreds or even thousands players, the program gives you huge options to filter through your players.

If you want to test filtering, I suggest you log in to already created test account (login: test123, password: test123) which already contains seven real-life footballers on which you can test how filtering system works.

Few important things:

 - when creating an account, you have to input an e-mail with at least one "." and at least one "@". Otherwise it will be considered as invalid e-mail and you won't be able to create your account.
 - when you select Footballer in the Table, by clicking RMB you will get options to either edit or delete the footballer from the list.
 - when you select Footballer in the Table, you can click "DELETE" on your keyboard it will enable deleting functionality.


If anyone comes across it and tries it, I would be extremly grateful for reporting any bugs or stuff that can be changed so the program is more pleasent to the users.
